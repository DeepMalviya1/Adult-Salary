**Logistic Regression:**
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.


**Dataset:** Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
